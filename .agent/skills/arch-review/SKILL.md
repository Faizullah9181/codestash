# Improve Codebase Architecture

Surface architectural friction and propose **deepening opportunities** — refactors that turn shallow modules into deep ones. The aim is testability and AI-navigability.

## Glossary

Use these terms exactly in every suggestion. Consistent language is the point — don't drift into "component," "service," "API," or "boundary." Full definitions in [LANGUAGE.md](LANGUAGE.md).

- **Module** — anything with an interface and an implementation (function, class, package, slice).
- **Interface** — everything a caller must know to use the module: types, invariants, error modes, ordering, config. Not just the type signature.
- **Implementation** — the code inside.
- **Depth** — leverage at the interface: a lot of behaviour behind a small interface. **Deep** = high leverage. **Shallow** = interface nearly as complex as the implementation.
- **Seam** — where an interface lives; a place behaviour can be altered without editing in place.
- **Adapter** — a concrete thing satisfying an interface at a seam.
- **Leverage** — what callers get from depth.
- **Locality** — what maintainers get from depth: change, bugs, knowledge concentrated in one place.

Key principles (see [LANGUAGE.md](LANGUAGE.md) for the full list):

- **Deletion test**: imagine deleting the module. If complexity vanishes, it was a pass-through. If complexity reappears across N callers, it was earning its keep.
- **The interface is the test surface.**
- **One adapter = hypothetical seam. Two adapters = real seam.**

This skill is _informed_ by the project's domain model. The domain language gives names to good seams; ADRs record decisions the skill should not re-litigate.

## Process

### 1. Explore

Read the project's domain glossary and any ADRs in the area you're touching first.

Then walk the codebase organically and note where you experience friction:

- Where does understanding one concept require bouncing between many small modules?
- Where are modules **shallow** — interface nearly as complex as the implementation?
- Where have pure functions been extracted just for testability, but the real bugs hide in how they're called (no **locality**)?
- Where do tightly-coupled modules leak across their seams?
- Which parts of the codebase are untested, or hard to test through their current interface?

Apply the **deletion test** to anything you suspect is shallow.

### 2. Present candidates

Present a numbered list of deepening opportunities. For each candidate:

- **Files** — which files/modules are involved
- **Problem** — why the current architecture is causing friction
- **Solution** — plain English description of what would change
- **Benefits** — explained in terms of locality and leverage, and also in how tests would improve

**Use CONTEXT.md vocabulary for the domain, and [LANGUAGE.md](LANGUAGE.md) vocabulary for the architecture.**

**ADR conflicts**: if a candidate contradicts an existing ADR, only surface it when the friction is real enough to warrant revisiting. Mark it clearly (e.g. _"contradicts ADR-0007 — but worth reopening because…"_).

Do NOT propose interfaces yet. Ask the user: "Which of these would you like to explore?"

### 3. Design the interface

For the chosen candidate, use the parallel interface design process in [INTERFACE-DESIGN.md](INTERFACE-DESIGN.md).

### 4. Plan the deepening

Once the user picks an interface, plan the deepening using [DEEPENING.md](DEEPENING.md):

- Classify dependencies (in-process / local-substitutable / remote-owned / true-external)
- Identify existing tests that will become waste
- Plan migration in safe increments

Present the plan as a numbered checklist. Get user approval.

### 5. Implement

Work through the checklist. After each step, run the test suite. Never leave tests red between steps.

At the end:

- [ ] Old unit tests on now-merged modules deleted
- [ ] New tests at the deepened interface pass
- [ ] Tests assert on observable outcomes, not internal state
